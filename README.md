# CitiBike_Analysis

# Overview
  # Purpose
    There are a group of investors that are in Des Moines, Iowa that want to create a bike sharing program like Citi Bank bike sharing program in New York City. The bike share data from New York City was downloaded then analyzed to then be presented by Tableau to the investors. 
    Questions to be answered by this analysis are:
    -the length of time that bikes are checked out for for all riders and genders
    -the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
    -the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

# Summary 
The analysis helped to get an image of what the Des Moines bike share program could look like if the base if off of New York City numbers. We can conclude and see that higher users were males and subscribers to the ride share program. Most of the use of the bikes would be during the commuting hours of the weekdays. 

  # Suggeseted Analysis
  I think it would be good to see an age representation of who uses the bike. Different ages would show how long a certain age groups would use the shared bikes. Another way to use age is comparing the different age groups with subscribed bike users than not.
